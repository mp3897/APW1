    <h1><b>Project</b></h1>
    <p>For my project, I want to make a multiplayer 2D or 2.5D (3D models in a 2D space) fighting game like Guilty Gear -Strive- or BlazBlue Centralfiction with Visual Novel elements for story telling in C# using Unity. This has been a passion project of mine for a while, and I want my game to create cool moments, and generate a sizable dedicated community like with Street Fighter Third Strike and <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzS96auqau0">Evo Moment 37</a>. I want to add a cast of unique characters that are all fun to play, and embody the different fighting styles throughout the genre's history. Along with this cast, I want to add unique system / universal mechanics for this game as well as adding a Roman Cancel system (from Guilty Gear) as I really enjoy using it.I also want to add a soundtrack reminiscent of my favorite entries to the genre, as well as maps that take place at beautiful, stylistic vistas. If I have time, along with the fighting game itself, I want to add a story mode that really works to add more depth to the characters.
