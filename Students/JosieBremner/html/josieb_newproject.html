<h2>Welcome to my senior year project page</h2>

<p> I was in charge on the CSS front of the class website project. I spent my time working on a test version of APW1 to design differenct viewable differences that the class would ultimatly vote to decide how we would want our class website to look. My group and I then made this changes on the offical master branch so they would reflect in the actual class website. I learned how to play around with different CSS designs and that much of the code that was written years ago was doing nothing and was not needed for the class website. After learning lots and lots about CSS, I now want to learn more about HTML because that is what I struggled with during the class website project. My goals are to know HTML, front and back, and then be able to reflect that on my own project page by making it more advanced than it is now. I will use a program to learn this but I do not know which one yet. I want to talk to Mr. Golanka and Mr. Lindow about which would be good to use once I get back to school. </p>

<p> What is HTML?: HTML is the code that is used to write the majority of websites. This is becuase it is used to create pages which makes websites functional. HTML works hand in hand with CSS to help with the design concepts of websites. Therefore, this project with emphasis more on how to build than design.</p>

<p> What are tags and attributes?: Tags and attributes are the basis of HTML.

They work together but perform different functions â€“ it is worth investing 2 minutes in differentiating the two.</p>

<p> What are HTML tags?: Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are usually enclosed in angle brackets. An example of a tag is: < h 1 >.

Most tags must be opened < h 1 > and closed < / h 1 > in order to function (without the spaces inbetween).</p>

<p> What are HTML attributes: Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the form of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside.

An example of an attribute is:

< img src="mycat.jpg" alt="A photo of my cat.">

In this instance, the image source (src) and the alt text (alt) are attributes of the < img> tag. </p>

<p> Golden Rules!!!: The vast majority of tags must be opened (<tag>) and closed (</tag>) with the element information such as a title or text resting between the tags.
When using multiple tags, the tags must be closed in the order in which they were opened.</p>

<p> Semester Update: I spent the past couple weeks focusing on how to nail the basics of HTML and really focus into the most import and nessasary concepts before diving deeper in playing with HTML. When I first learned HTML I felt lost becuase there was so much information at one time, now that I have been able to focus on one thing at a time I have a better time connecting all the concepts and seeing how they all work together. After engraving these rules into my brain and using concepts I have learned in the past years about using HTML on my own project page I will be able to spend most of the next semester making a really cool website that I can expirment new concepts with. I will be attempting to construct this by using what I know in my brain and not online, but if there is something I really cannot figure out I will look back on my project from last year to see if I can find the answer. I am really excited to combine my creativity with this web page. </p>
