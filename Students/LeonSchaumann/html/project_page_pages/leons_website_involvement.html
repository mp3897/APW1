        My job on the website project was to be the manager for the backend team, but I turned into more of a general manager later in the project.
        My job as the manager was to make sure that the backend team was on track with the project and that they were doing their jobs in addition to answering any questions they had.
        While we didn't get everything done that we would've hoped, I think it was still a great learning experience for everyone.
        I learned what it was like to work on a larger GitHub project— utilizing forked repositories and pull requests —and I also learned how to work with different branches.
        This included learning about the typical branch workflow (Feature -> Development -> Beta -> Production) and how to merge branches.
        On the actual coding side, there was not much I learned.
        I already knew the majority of the things that we created during the project, but I did get to do more research into CSS styling which was something I was lacking in.
        I also got to learn from the pre-existing code that was already in the project, which was a great learning experience— specifically, the JavaScript used to create the dynamic drop downs.
